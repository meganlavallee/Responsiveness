## Description
Welcome to my profile. A place for all my class work.

## User Story
The user will be able to go through pictures that I have taken as well as contact information to get a hold of me.  
        
        
## Installation
```
git clone from the github link down below to have it on your computer
Portfoilo deployment will be on webpage through Github. Users will be able to view items throughout my coding camp experience. 
```
## Technologies
First boxes were made and html's were created for the different pages that were needed in the assignment. Style sheet was made so edit and make the webpage look pretty. After everything was written out in html format a view was taken of how the webpage looked and editting the div containers started from there.  Imported photos from my personal computer to be of use making a portfolio.  Attached the pictures in the portfolio html for viewing pleasure.  

## Usage
Portfolio is a great way to showcase progression of my work from earlier to now.  This application is a mobile resume for anyone who is visual and looking into what someones work looks like.  Storing and showcasing your best work is important in a skill set that can not be demonstrated in words.
