Introduction:
Welcome to my profile. A place for all my class work. 

User Story:
The user will be able to go through pictures that I have taken as well as contact information to get a hold of me.  

Technological Outline:
First boxes were made and html's were created for the different pages that were needed in the assignment. Style sheet was made so edit and make the webpage look pretty. After everything was written out in html format a view was taken of how the webpage looked and editting the div containers started from there.  Imported photos from my personal computer to be of use making a portfolio.  Attached the pictures in the portfolio html for viewing pleasure.  

Division of Labor:
I, Megan, soley did all work for this.  

Conclusion:
This portfolio is a great way to showcase the best work and everything that has been done. 

Deployment:
Portfoilo deployment will be on webpage through Github. Users will be able to view items throughout my coding camp experience. 

Conclusion:
Portfolio is a great way to showcase progression of my work from earlier to now.  This application is a mobile resume for anyone who is visual and looking into what someones work looks like.  Storing and showcasing your best work is important in a skill set that can not be demonstrated in words.
